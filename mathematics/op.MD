Notes and code on linear and nonlinear optimization of pose graphs for vSLAMs are @/[slam-backend-i](https://github.com/florist-notes/aicore_n/blob/main/notes/code/slam/optimization.MD) and @github/[slam-backend-ii](https://github.com/florist-notes/aicore_n/blob/main/notes/code/slam/optimization2.MD). All my notes on visual SLAM can be found @github/[vSLAM](https://github.com/florist-notes/aicore_n/blob/main/notes/code/slam/README.MD).
